This new system improves the situation for families at the lower end 9of the economic ladder, and for those with larger families, but it also penalizes.-those with the ability and initiative to find work.\tome 3500 families in Tennessee were dropped from the AFDC program with the institution of,this n `:l system. `'t hese families were. already living well below the povet-ty level. ,'''Thus, while the Ratable Reduction method is a more equitable wayto divide the total AFDC budget, it does create a disincentive to work, surely a deplorable situation. The current cuts are causing\r\n- -\tgreat .hardships fob those already struggling below t\tpov xty\r\nlevel, All . ' this has brought into sharper focus t\t!-n MquAy. of the basic allocations.\r\nand 1977, the Department of human services returned\r\nBetween 1973\t~\r\nover S5 million-dollars of appropriated, but unexpended funds for AFDC, for .use by other departments of the state government. Until the recent adoption of the Ratable. Reduction method, grants had not been raised in 7 years. These developments have taken place during a period of rapid inflation, while lower income. families in-this state have paid a higher per cent of their income for state and local taxes than have upper income families. We might also mention that the salaries of public officials have been protected during this period by the cost of living increase. 1111 of this presents an intolerable situation for AFDC recipients and for Tennesseans who have a conscience and who care about the needs of children.\r\n\r\nThe Department .of Human Services budget proposal would have allowed a 1% increase in AFDC grants. However, this token proposal was made impossible by the deletion of 4)-1.3 million by the Department of Finance and Administration. The 1A increase would not have corrected the situation nor would it have allowed an adequate income level for these dependent families.\r\nWe urge the General Assembly to carefully review the probl-jn.s we\r\nhave mentioned. We suggest that the 1969 S.tand.ar _of Nee-`.=degree-~__\t revised to account for the tremendous increase in the cost of living in the past seven years.; We hope that AFDC grants can be increased, gradually if necessary, 'until they are brought more in line with a decent standard of living. We support th ret rp of\r\nthe $163 milIon, &o the budget, as a step in the ri\t*di\ttimn., - It is important for us to remember that at stake in t s issue are -the developing minds and bodies of our young children. Our AFDC money is an investment in Tennessee's future. How much is a brighter. future. for all of our children worth?"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/9338/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:9339/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9338/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/volvoices","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9338","label":{"en":["Testimony of the League of Women Voters of Kingsport-Sullivan County"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/date/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/subject/families-dependent-families-children.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/place/contemporary-united-states-1968-present.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/time-period/undefined.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"Testimony of the League of Women Voters of Kingsport-Sullivan County - Volunteer Voices ","description":"Untitled","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/works/testimony-of-the-league-of-women-voters-of-kingsport-sullivan-county","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A9338/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"Testimony of the League of Women Voters of Kingsport-Sullivan County"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true}
