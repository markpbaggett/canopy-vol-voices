This reconstruction is of a summer council house, not the original house. The original council house would have been much larger in order to accommodate the nearly 5000 people who would have gathered there. By 1832, the state of Georgia had refused the Cherokee the right to hold council meetings unless the meeting dealt with treaties that gave away their lands. The Cherokee decided to move their capital from New Echota, Georgia across the state line to Red Clay, Tennessee because the state of Tennessee did not prohibit the Cherokees from meeting together. Thus, Red Clay became the seat of the Cherokee government in 1832 and lasted until the removal of the Cherokees to the west in 1838. Red Clay was composed of 11 general councils and the meetings were attended by up to 5000 people. It was at Red Clay that the Cherokee learned that they had lost all of their land and would be removed to the west. Red Clay consists of the sacred Blue Hole Spring, a reconstructed council house, and several reconstructed homestead buildings. Red Clay is also the home to the Eternal Flame, lit on April 6, 1984. The Cherokees took hot coals from their council fire at Red Clay on the Trail of Tears. The flame was later taken to Cherokee, North Carolina in the 1950s but was returned to Red Clay in 1984."]},"metadata":[{"label":{"en":["Date"]},"value":{"en":["1980"]}},{"label":{"en":["Format"]},"value":{"en":["photographs"]}},{"label":{"en":["Extent"]},"value":{"en":["1 digital image; 1 photograph"]}},{"label":{"en":["Subject"]},"value":{"en":["Native Americans","Government and Politics","Architecture"]}},{"label":{"en":["Place"]},"value":{"en":["Red Clay (Tenn.)","Bradley County (Tenn.)"]}},{"label":{"en":["Time Period"]},"value":{"en":["Era 4 - Expansion and Reform (1801-1861)"]}},{"label":{"en":["Description"]},"value":{"en":["This photograph is of a reduced scale reconstruction of the Cherokee council house at the Red Clay site at Red Clay State Park in Bradley County, Tennessee.
