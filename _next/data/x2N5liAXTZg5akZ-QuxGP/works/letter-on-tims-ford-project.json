If the Senate bill includes funds for both projects this would, as you say, assure that construction of 'Urns Ford would begin this year. But at the same time, such action would, in all likelihood, insure that no funds for Tellico would be in the final bill. This I cannot endorse.\r\n\r\nI would like to see funds for both projects approved. The best way to achieve this result is to insure that there is a meaningful conference on the question between the Senate and the House. It is for this reason and this reason alone that I recommended to the committee that the Senate bill contain funds for Tellico only. Should the Senate follow my recommendations, both projects would be before the Conference Committee. I have strong hopes, though I cannot guarantee, that a Confeeence between the Senate and the House in which both projects would be on an equal footing would result in approval of both.\r\n\r\nI am sure you appreciate the fact that I cannot approach Lhis matter from the standpoint of personal preference. Throughout my Coggressional service I have supported the recommendations of the TVA Board on questions concerning the construction and location of projects and the priority as between projects. I am formally committed to this course in this instance and I sincerely believe that such a course is in the long-range best interests of the IVA and, more importantly, in the best interests of the people it serves and whom I have the honor to represent.\r\n\r\nI emphasize again that I support both projects and will seek with all the influence and persuasion I possess to ha',-e both approved. But if it develops that only one of the projects can be started this year, then I must follow my commitment\r\nand my con ictions in support of the recommendations of the TVA Board.\r\n\r\nWith kindest regards and best wishes.
