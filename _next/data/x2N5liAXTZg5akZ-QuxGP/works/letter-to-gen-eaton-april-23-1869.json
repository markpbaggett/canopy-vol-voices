Guild make a speech\r\n\r\nSketch of Guilds speech\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens of Overton  The abolitionists of the north have waged a war against us from the rock bound coast of Main to the Gold guilt shores of california  our lives are in danger we must arise and defend our homes and firesides the homes of the brave and free . . .\r\n\r\nLet us arise at once and with a fair field and a free fight the soutern banner will float and triumph everywhere . . .\r\n\r\nThere are some things amongs us calling themeselves mere men but I tell you the hallows will stink with the carcases of such as dare to vote union  They will all be hering after the 8th of June and the good work should commence now \r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nThe class of his speech\r\n\r\nAll hail to gallant Tennessee who on the 8th of June will throw off old Abe Lincolns yokr As he threw off the old scarlet cloak which the old cowardly tyrant wore To escape the plugs of Baltimore\r\n\r\nSworn statements about Guilds Speech\r\n\r\nExract from R Dowdys Testimony\r\n\r\nDid you hear Josephe C Guild make a speech in the town of Livingston in May 1861 if so state what he said about union men or those who would vote union on the following election\r\n\r\nans\r\n\r\nYes sir he said all that voted in that way aught to be hung it was well enough to commence the good work now.  The Rebels who were present cheerd this speech by stamping on the floor\r\n\r\nAmbros Grace testifies to the same in substance\r\n\r\nQues\r\n\r\nDid you hear Judge Guild make a speech at Livingston if so state the subsance and effect of it\r\n\r\nans\r\n\r\nI did in may 1861 he said that the union men and every man who voted union would be hung and the good work whould commence It was the most inflamitory speech I ever herd it had a tendency to rouse the rebel citizens agains the union men he desired the destination of every union man wished them all hung . . . . \r\n\r\nCullom advocated Judge Guild and ad said he would like to be the hangman5\r\n\r\nAt the close of culloms speech a meeting was held and resolutions passed declaring that no union speeched should be made in the county of overton\r\n\r\nOn the next day a few of us gathered guns and met at monroe for the purpose of defending Mr Maynard should the Rebels attempt to prevent his filling his appointment but no one attempted to break up the meeting.  That evening a large number of citizens gathered at my mills where mr maynard made another speech\r\n\r\nElection day came on and Fentress gave a large majority against separation  So did the bordering districts of overton  and so far as my information extends I am satisfyed that a large majority in the state would have voted right but for fear.\r\n\r\nAfter the result was announced the rebel element became more bold and were constantly threatening the union people\r\n\r\nNot long after the election our people held a meeting and slected delegates to the Greenvill convention I was a memeber from Fentress with authority to vote for overton but on account of not hering the time of meeting in season I did not attend  This was another charge against me\r\n\r\nDuring the month of June 1861 I had propositions from various sources to go north and procure arms machines amunition etc for the use of Rebels and was told that I might set my sum\r\n\r\n[text in left margin]\r\n\r\n*The allowing this election to go on was a mistake after Maynard was driven from Livingston  I told him it would be useless to attend the election unless we did so with bullets and I thought we should do that whoever we had the power and I thought we were participating in a crime by aiding in the election in any way  I said the same to Johnson and Brigg but they all insisted that the election should go on and that we the union men should all go to the polls6\r\n\r\nthe amount was immaterial on my final and determined refusal I was warned by men claiming to be friends that my property would be confiscated and a force would be sent sifficiently large to capture me\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of July nearly all my neighbors joined in a celebration at my mills we had a very hapy time considering the circumstances  This was another grave offence and I was arned on the 6th that a considerable force were then enrout to affect my capture\r\n\r\nI gathered my family white and black and went to the town of Albany clinton co Ky. on the 11th of July I started north for the purpose of procuring arms and amunition for the union men of Tennessee on my arrival at Cincinnati I met Genl Nelson and was directed by him to return and gather what men we could and meet him at dick Roberston on the 6th of august  About 50 men who had collected at my house in albany started for dick Robertson  while enrout we overtook 150 men coming in from Morgan and Roan cos Tenn and journeyed to gether men continued to gether at camp Dick prepository to go on the expidition to E.L. untill the 1st bull run battle  That for the time put a stop to the the meditated raid into Tenn\r\n\r\nNot Long after Genl Thomas arrival 7 \r\n\r\ncommand at camp rich he ordered an expedition to Albany for the purpose of recruiting and also with the design of holding that point  The expedition consisted of two companies of Ky House guards from the bluegrass region in Ky two companies of the 4th Ky cavalary and two companies of recruits from Clinton Ky overton and Fentress cos\r\n\r\nThe Rebels were then encamped in overton two rebels north from monroe their force was considerable larger than our men and they had been reinforced by a company of the \"Bull Pups\" from McMairys Battalian\r\n\r\nOur bluegrass friends expressed a desire to capture a bull pup and carey him home Wadford argued that they might try and and he would make the attack upon the Rebels and the day following  Scouts were sent out that might to gain information as to the enemys strength all was in readyness but in the morning our blue grass men were all gone home the went wih out their pups so the expidition was abandoned the camp broken up and men fell back across the Cumberland at Waitsboro\r\n\r\nHere the 12th Ky Infantry was reunited and organized  To this Rigt I and about 25 men were attached as scouts there and about somerset we spent the winter matching the Rebels about mill springs untiting for Genl Thomas to come up by way of columbia\r\n\r\n[text in left margin]\r\n\r\nWhile I was absent at camp Dick Robertson my wife sent out son a lad to our mill to [illegible] some meal some rebel soldiers and citizens took him prisoner and kept him a week and were about to [illegible] him south when some Rebels [illegible] albany interfered and he was released8\r\n\r\nMy duty and orders were to watch the enemy guard the outposts and see that we were not surprised\r\n\r\nThe duty was severe as I could not trust men several of whom got captured and two killed and I slept but little often walking thoguth snow or rain during the entire night one time I remember while our rigt was encamped at Waitsboro the outer picket came in with the repost that the woods was full of Indians they had seen some and herd a great many There was snow on the ground and rain and sleet was falling I went out and walked all night and could find nothing but the wind howled amongs the trees and the trees made some noise by rapping together I spent several days and nights west of the white oak creek one day myself and one man were near where some Rebs were robing an old butcher two Rebs went off by them selves my men followed and killed one of them and all the others ran and I afterwards learned that they did not stop until reaching their encampment another time we listened by a house where their pickets were staying and heard their boast of what they had done and would do after listening some time we fired in on them and there was another stampede\r\n\r\nWhen Genl Thomas arrived at Columbia on his way to attack the Rebels at mill springs I was directed to send a dispatch to him\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nThe roads being infested with Rebels and the papers being very important I went myself on the little fishing creek I fell in with the [notorians] John Morgan traveled along with him some little distance when we separated he satisfyed I was one of the Mill Springs rebs on my return I came through the woods and along by patty \r\n\r\nA day or so afterwards I carried another paper to the Genl with plans and sudjestions I again returned by a private way\r\n\r\nOn the day of Genl Thomas arrival at Logans old fields (the battle ground) I was directed to acompany Gen Schoepf to  his Genl Thomas Head Quarters\r\n\r\nIn the evening Genl Schoepf prepared to return to Somersett I requested permission to remain stating as a reason that I was assured by some of my scouts that the Rebels intends to attack us I that I might be of services as I knew the country and nearly every bypath and those I did not know I coud easily find men that did\r\n\r\nThat night I was called to Genl Thomas Hd Qrs and ordered to pilot a force to surround an old field with the view as I was informed of captureing as encampment of Rebels  I expressed my opinion to the Genl that there were not Rebels at the old fields  Robt McCook then col of the 9th Ohio Inf said he was certain they were there as he had gained the information that evening 10\r\n\r\nI then sudjested that it might be well to learn further about the matter [l..f..] marching out the troops  Genl Thomas faivored the plan and I was sent out  The resuld was as I had anticipated there were no rebels about the old fields and no appearance of them haveing been any\r\n\r\nThe next day I traveled on foot from daylight untill 11 o. at night through the mud and a delugeing rain waiding branches crossing ravenes to the cumberland River and had to [w...tt...] three mills of our camp going at least forty miles in my circuitous rambling from which place I sent a dispatch to Genl Thomas informing him that there was no force of Rebels west of the White Oak Creek that all had gone in and there was evidently some [m...] on hand in the Rebel camp I remained with a [new casel] untill daylight being too much fatigued to go into camp  Early in the morning  I herd fireing in the direction of our picketts  I procured a horse from New [casel] and started for camps on my arrival the troops were nearly all away and I followed on in the direction of firing in a few minutes I met adjutant Genl who informed me that Genl Thomas had sent orders for me to report to him immediately I di so and wasdirected to proceed with all haste Somersett and order Genl Schoepf to muster the reserves and march at once to the lower ford if fishing creed and if possible intersept the retreating Rebels  I rode rapidly away through mud in many places knee deep  In going along [a lone] through mud and water at places two feet deep my horse stumbled or steped in a hole fell and threw me over his head entirely submerging me in the mud and water and before I could recover my self he got up and ran or stumbled over me bruising my ams and injuring my head _ I must have been uncontiess for a time for the first I recovered I was in the act of mounting my horse the bruises seemed to have very little effect upon me at the time for I rode on as rapidly as before the fall (I cant hear so well since) on reaching the widow campbell I met major      of the 1st Ky cavalry who earnestly enquired the news  The widow has a daughter and Grandaughter (violent Rebels) came out and laught at me I did not wander much as I was completely covered with mud and my head and face was bloddy  I motioned the major for water with which I washed out my mouth a little off my face and then told major we had killed Zollicoffer and the rebs were running like mad12\r\n\r\nour men set up a sh---t the ------- co--------cy became much slongated the major gave me a fresh horse and I may away as reaching the creek I famed it much smaler almost part forceing but I got across and soon reached Genl Schoepfs Hd Qurts  The Genl and those with him viewed me with astonishment and I thought dismay but I started them to shouting with my good way.  On delivering Gel Shoep his orders I assumed him it would be impossible for him to cross the troops of lower ford of the creek during the day as we both could be had  He therefore determined to cross at the upper ford   While I was engageing in getting from my face and hair and changing my clothing the troops got in line and men on the ----- on ther way after the Rules where I overtook them some of the command was crossing the creek by holding to a rope that was stretched from bank to bank the all succeeding in crossin allthoug the waterran swiftly I was up to them run past  I passed them and reached Genl Thomas Hd Qrs after night and was directed by the Genl to go to the right for the right wing and remain with Gen      mill (illegible)"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/12500/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:12512/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/12500/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Letter to Gen.
