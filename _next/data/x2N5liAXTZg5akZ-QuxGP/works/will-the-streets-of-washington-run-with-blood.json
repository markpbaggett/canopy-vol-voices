Old Glory will bo hauled down and the red flag of Communism will be raised.\r\nNightmares? Those nightmares have occurred time and again, and in countries\r\nwhose culture and intelligence surpassed our own. Has human nature changed so\r\ngreatly since the days of Cromwell or of Robespierre? Let the World War answer that\r\nquestion. Yes; our methods have improved. The guillotine had its advantages to\r\nbe sure. Each victim endured the exquisite mental torture of witnessing the behead-\r\ning of his predecessor. But it is too slow a contrivance for modern revolutions.\r\nA hundred men standing at a wall; a fusillade from a hundred well aimed rifles; and a mass of quivering human bodies crumpled on the ground. Nightmares? Yes. Night-mares to which this planet has become only too well accustomed.\r\nBut it is impossible in '\"Tashin.gton, in Tew York, in Chicago: Who knows?\r\nEstablish the Prohibition Interregnum. Destroy the enforcement morale. Give the mobs rivers of liquor, and who shall say that the streets of Washington may yet not flow with blood and the Potomac run crimson to the sea? Not the guillctir,e, to be sure! But by modern methods, fifty men at a time, let us say. The members of a capitalistic Congress, at this rate, might easily be disposed of in half an hour. The lives of 5,000 financiers and industrialists could be snuffed out every five minutes by revolutionaries operating in only a hundred of our larger cities.\r\nIt is a big country and things would have to be done i.n a big way. Nightmares? Was not the word used by Louis XVI to the men who warned him of his fate?\r\n\r\nThe Country Editor, since its establishment as a magazine in the early part of the last decade, has see its face firmly against every radical proposal. It has\r\nstood for the Stars and Stripes as against Communism. It has stood for brotherly\r\nlove and mutual una?erstanding as against war. Today it believes that we are face to face with a tremendous catastrophe, and it raises its hand in warning.\r\nCopyright 1933\r\nTHE COUNTRY EDITOR PUBLISIHING CO.
