Camp New York, or Camp Suippes or Camp de Tahure, was located in Suippes, France and was established on damaged grassland after World War I.  The camp had medical triage, and military storage as well as providing safe harbor for troops.  Signs on the camp state that New York Mayor La Guardia aided in financing the camp. La Guardia was vehemently against Hitler and worked as early as 1935 to educate Americans to the danger of the Nazis, including their annihilation of the Jews in Germany. He was appointed the first director of the Office of Civilian Defense until 1942, and began work with the United Nations in 1946. Camp \"New York\" is still in operation as a military camp, but known as Camp \"Suippes\". The sign pictured reads: \"Dear Boys:\nThe mayor and the people of the city of New York send  you greetings and best wishes and with a deep feeling of pride and satisfaction adopt this camp and bestow upon it the name Camp New York. We rejoice with you in your glorious victories on the battlefield. The complete defeat of the Nazis was accomplished in a typical American way and, may I add, humanely so. We salute you and those fine boys who are not returning. To them we bow our heads in deep reverence and sorrow. It is our fervent hope and prayer that you will be restored to your loved ones before long and to this end, that our cruel enemies in the Pacific will be thoroughly crushed. God speed and God bless you all. Very sincerely yours, LaGuardia, Mayor.\""]},"metadata":[{"label":{"en":["Date"]},"value":{"en":["1945-10"]}},{"label":{"en":["Format"]},"value":{"en":["photographs"]}},{"label":{"en":["Extent"]},"value":{"en":["1 digital image; 1 photograph"]}},{"label":{"en":["Subject"]},"value":{"en":["Military camps--France","World War, 1939-1945--Military facilities--American","World War, 1939-1945--Military life","Wars and Military"]}},{"label":{"en":["Place"]},"value":{"en":["Putnam County (Tenn.)"]}},{"label":{"en":["Time Period"]},"value":{"en":["Era 8 - The Great Depression and World War II (1929-1945)"]}},{"label":{"en":["Description"]},"value":{"en":["An image of a sign placed in Camp New York.
