There were originally three sets of these books, but due to the changing of the supervision in TVA, two of the sets were destroyed. The last remaining set was in my care for about 25 years until I showed the books to Mrs. Nina Finley. She suggested that I put the books on display in the Library so other people could see what the beginning of the Cumberland Steam Plant looked like. I was honored that someone like her was interested in something that I took for granted.
