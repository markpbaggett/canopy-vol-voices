On or after that day, take your War Ration Book Two with you when you go to buy any kind of these processed foods.\r\nYOU GIVE MANY POINTS\tYOU GIVE LESS POINTS\r\nFOR SCARCE FOODS\tFOR FOODS.THAT ARE\r\nNOT SO SCARCE\r\n2. Before you buy, find out how many points to give for the kind of processed foods you want. Frtces do not set the points. Tito- GisvvtmlteuL will set different points for each kind and size no matter what the price. Your grocer will put up the official list of points where you can see it. It will also be in the newspapers. The points will not change just because the prices do.\r\nWhen you.buy, take the right amount of blue stamps out of the book. Do this in front of your grocer or delivery man and hand them to him. The grocer must collect a ration stamp, or stamps, for all the rationed processed foods he sells. Every rationed processed\r\nfood will take points as well as money.\r\nDo not use more stamps than you need to make up the right amount. For example, if the food you buy calls for 13 points it is better to tear out an 8-point and a 5-point stamp than two 5-\r\npoint stamps and a 2- and\t8'+\r\n1-point stamp. Save your\r\nsmaller point stamps for low-point foods. You can take the stamps from more than one book belonging to your house-hold if you need to.\r\nEvery person in your house-hold, including children of any age, has a total of 48 points to use for all these processed foods for one ration period. This means that you may use ALL the blue stamps marked\r\nA, B, and C from all the books\r\nduring the first period. You may use as many of the blue A, B, and C stamps as you wish at one time. When they are used up you will not be able to buy any more of these processed foods till the next stamps are good. The Government will announce the date when the next stamps are good.\r\n\r\nUse your household's points carefully so that you will not run out of stamps. And buy with care to make your points come out even, because the grocer will not be able to give you change in stamps. Use high-point stamps first, if you can.\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nYou may use ALL the books of the household to buy processed foods for the household. Anyone you wish can take the ration books to the store to do the buying for you or your household.\r\nWe cannot afford to waste food or give some people more than their fair share. . . . That is why canned fruits and vegetables are rationed and that is why meat is going to be rationed. Rationing of some foods is the best and fairest way to be sure that every American gets enough to eat.\r\n3. 4.\r\nBE SURE TO READ\r\nOTHER SIDE\r\nU S GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE : 1943 16--32240-1\r\nU.
