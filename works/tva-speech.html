C.\r\naddress you upon a subject of high iaportanoe not alone to the two and one pair million poop)* in six Southeastern states whose electrical needs are served by Vim Tennessee Valley Authority, an a ,eatc y of the government in the United Stater , but a question of importance also to the entire nation. This Speech is occasioned by the fact that the other body of Con ,re se on lost 1Fdegreeriday adopted an amendment to the bill appropriating; funds forth* TVA, offered by the Senior Member of that body Prot' the State of Tennessee., that has such farreachi neoni.n , should it becou :e low, ae not only seriously to heaper both the hopes ami prospects of the people of this great region for social and industrial development but aotual.l,:e to change the basic character of tz * nation's greatest and most nuocossful a er - ent in unified regional develop-neat, possibly changing its prospoots of even greater success and achievement to an outlook of atrophy and ultimate failure.\r\ni ik ns thane rerarke, I do not question in any y the motives of the Senior ..her of the other tar from my state. This gont:eman has worked too hard and has done too much for the developrent of the hydro-e loc trio, flood, and navigation facilities of the Tenr-ege-e and other rivers for tom+- to think\r\nthat he desires to Ao, or believes that he is doing, a disoervioo either to the people of his *tote and nation or to this ;great public utility. I can only interpret his action as nistoken jud6oent.\r\nI have referred to the TVA as an experiment in unified regional develop-tent. it w thus conceived and planned, the first of its kind. It was by no means the first time the government had undertaken a project of flood control or to make a stream navigable. Nor was it the first adventure in public ownership of power facilities. ghat was new was the plan to coordinate not only theta purposes and functions in one project but to unify and correlate them not only with themselves but with the development of an entire river vaz.ieey, immeasurably rich in natural and human resources.\r\nThe enthusiast.. with which the overwhelmin ; majority of the people of this region have accepted and supported the pro jeot has only been matched by the virulency and determination of its opponents.\r\nCongress, which with the President created the TVA. has steadfastly biven it support. It is now an immense developments the largest en3 nearing . and construction job aver carried out by one single annoy, pub1 c or private, in the na ti on e e historydegree.\r\nTo he sure, it has cost a lot of money. Over 0000000,000 of the people's honey has been spent upon the program. But the whole project belongs to the people, and I believe it is a good investment.\r\nTo Ay oolles ;ues who are the elected representatives of the people and the guardians of *their interests, there would naturally arise the question; that have the people got for their money? This question can be answered,\r\nwalleyes satisfactorily.\r\n',fret, let me point out the utterly invaluable contributions of the TVA facilities to the war program. Electrical energy, one might almost .q, is the life blood of modern mar production. Yhon war descended upon us with such sudden treachery and our need for planes became so acute, the nation had this great auras of electrical energy for production of aluminum. degree lectrical power from the TVA facilities has produced a major part of the aluminum for America's aircraft. At one critical point of the war, it produced more than one-half. And lot it be remembered that to make one large bomber takes more electricity than the average American family would use in four hundred years.\r\n:3ut aluminum is only one\r\ninto being by and because of the TVA have turned out a rt cord of war production which, once the full story can be told, will, in gy opinion, forever justify this groat national development and investment. ven now, one of the nation's largest, east strategic, and highly secret war pro jeots is under urgent construction somewhere within the valley, served by TVA power.\r\nThe TVA es contrib ation to the war, however, is not the only thing the people of the nation have to show for their money. The TVA and ' its far-flung facilities can conservative] be regarded as a ,very- valuable capital asset.\r\nIts properties are new and it is, in fact, a '+-' ' v1ncern of proven feasibility.\r\nexsa; 4ple. The production fac pities Drowns\r\na\r\n\r\n.i4'tr one\tr U.* per capita level of income U ' t region's people,\r\nthe still far too law, has shown a healthy increase.\t1940, the per\r\ncapita income\tthe\tt..\tTennessee V far states shy a 73increase over the level of 1933, while the national increase .or the ea period was only 56;x. As a result of this inerea ed inoeme, the increase in income taxes paid to the goverment fro ; that region is considerably above the increase for the country as a whole.\r\nThe benefits to the tuition hy making this 4rest river navigable must 'be considered as similar to the benefits of eakira ma other of the nation's rivers navitable. The benefits go not only to shippers, industries, and consumers usin ;; the nation's navigable e channels, Out the business enterprise and the economic activity of the entire nation is given a boon, th reby\" b efittia the whole people. i .lady, we must consider the flood control investment on the Tennessee River and in that valley as a protection fromAiMm, has 3.s similar to that provided by flood control projects on can y other of the nation's etrea :,s.\r\nI mention some of the above thinks not, to avoid a dollar and wont\tr ti oc on the nation's investment in TVA power facilities, but to euphemise that the power facilities are by no ans the only national benefit frog the TVA.\r\nAs to the power, the answer is not so difficult, because power is sold and revenues provide a dollar and cent Leta\tant. It is not a discuura4ing\r\nrecord either. Yor instance, during the last fiscal year, income trim power\r\n-a-\r\n\r\nsales amounted to more than 031, 500, 0010. After deduotint the expenses to proauee and. di6tribute that power, including tax payments and liberal de-predation allowances, there was a surplus of more than nI3,000,000. This would :indicate that the people have she a Good. investment ie there power\r\n.1 -\r\nfacilities.\t-clad Caae).n\u003en-ea--t'\r\nWlile thin operation has i en satisfactory results to the peopIthas a\r\n\r\nwhole, it has been a boon and a blessini; to the people of the Tennessee Valley. that, then, is the justification or the reason for this disturbing swendmant? I do not think there is sufficient justification, and I shall not here undertake to discover a reason, if any.\r\n\r\nThe aaendment,etiah the other body hae adopted and which may soon be\r\n\r\na question before the House, requires that all receipts of the TVA, every ere and however collected, must be paid into the general funds of the Treasury, just as taxes, import duty or any other ordinary ,:overmaental revenue. Once in the general funds of the Trensury, these r-- venues would be co-a: Bled with the other revenues of the United States. There woad be no earnrkin,\r\nno identification\r\nthose funds. In other ords, when a ex Anwar of TVA\r\nelectricity paid his light bill, it would not do into the operating funds of\r\nthis public utility, as 'the case eith every other utility in the United States, 1\r\nbut it Nould ip into the general revenue or the United States just like income tax payment s.\r\ne those nottloo are\tt h e\tral f\ttb r*aoury, they. *an a\r\nbe wit\tthe A or ' any other s Apr\tart t boy' a\tprrpriatod\r\nGorsam.\r\naa under this proposal, the receipts tre the\t.c\ta *mild\r\nno for ho a ailabie, as thny are now, to i the ordinary' *Ming expenses of tiao A wd. only tho not pro da required to he paid into the Troosury gonorol lei stoadJ.1l receipts **old, as l Now said, become government menu, and\tVA would have to rely\tdot appropriations 'r (on a- sa for ty solitary p.m,- of its expondits.\r\n?orhaps it, would be bleu,,,, 4r, Spoakor,\tmaw briefly the history\r\nnot of the omits TVA, 'which is not i\testi.a bon, but the\tr of handling\r\nthe receipts of the int.\tthe original.

As an example, the TVA. Trent before the Beau of the Bud et in pte er, 19430 to present esti -tes of their expenditures for the fiscal year begins next Jul , and ending JUm 30, 1445. The bill presently under discussion embodies these estimates. Fortunately, the TVA\r\n\r\nthe\r\nip asking for\tapprppriation of no new wnney for next year, asking only\r\ntt'.\r\nThe use of its receipts ,i. a to ti.`~.s public utility a business-like\r\n\r\n\r\nlexibiliLy. Increased expenditures reflected in increased needs for power which can not be accurately anticipated, would man increased revenue. The two \"veld likely offset eaeh other and maybe the increased business would melt in a benefit to this agonoy versed by the people. As an example in\r\n\r\n\r\npoint, in 1939, just after the declaration of war\tGroat ritairi, the Aluminum Company of Trios located in O is Walley, found itself in critical need for ,ure power cat of an inoreasi g dew for aluminum. As it happened, the supply of power from its own hydro facilities was actually'\r\n\r\n\r\ndecreased because of a drouth. This company\tr\tv appealed\tthe i VAeT2degreeis TVA\r\nsupplied a large block of power, largely brining into operation some of\r\n\r\n\r\nits standby steam plants. The company paid to the TVA for this power 4,600,000. in producing thAt power, the TVA spent ;1,300, tom, leaving a profit to this agency\r\nThe TVA was able o enter into such a contract because it could use its slag\" increased inao to pay its increased expense, It con d nut have dome it,\r\n4440.4 0hotAsef\r\n.00j. ArihotoO.\t1A.0-el'00\"\r\nwithout consiJerati1e delay; if it had been necessary\ttq4pas an appropriation bill.\r\nShow suppose that instead of continuing this bush se like methods we require the ?VGA, as is proposed by this amendment, to pay all of its receipts into the 'Treasury as revenue and come to Congress for the appropriation of all of its expenditures for the innumerable details and contingencies for the opera.tion of a very large utility business. How could Con .res.s do this intelli; ently with our praeont :lethoUs ? Lice coati even the 'i a , and nuoh less the CoR r ss, accurately estivate the detailed expenditures of such a huge business operation a year or more in advance?\r\nto\r\nThe first big contingency would be AbapredictAbieity of the weather,\r\nparticular in the TVA region. There is always the poeeibi .ity of a dry year. *ben a drought oo es, less power can be produced frog, the h ro--electric ; ene rats g facilities and, therefore, r ore power would necessarily have to se produced from steam plants. Ono difference beaten electricity and other products in that it can not be stored. It must be transported and used when produced. Constant supply moans constant production. ontinuiay of supply is essential. What is one thing customers\t' for. Se,\t-n poser can not be produced $ufficieftl. from hydro facilities, the standby stews plants must be used.\r\nUow it coats ire to produce power by the stoaa plants than by the\r\nas ten aillion dollars\r\nfactor 4y *Job it is permitted to charge proportionately more for the electricity *doh it has to produce frog: steam plants.\tre, again, the increased oost of operation is taken care of by increased J1mm:a.\r\nEnt under the nethod proposed by the a;mndwont, all of the receipts, inoladir the oompensatorily increased rates, 000ld go into the general fund\r\nof tire Treasury and there would be no corresponding inorease in the previous.4 fixed amount* appropriated for Ant by the TVrinch increased expenditures, made\r\nnecessary by drouth, co:ad not be made except by passage of another priation ion bill unless, of course, the TVA appropriation bill soon ta:rata a largo\r\ncontiaont rum, :1ich is another nn,e for a blank-cheek appropri4tion.\r\nThe second emit important contir,, c_es aboat throuh auto of Uod, such as flash floods, tornadoes, and storms. Those 04n not be accurately ..aiLie-i-Ineed nor could proper provisions be made for thaw under the 4004dweet except, again, through a large contingent fund.\r\nThe third large (lontingency arises out of =anticipated denands for electrical Z;X now industry, 1'w-instance, or increased activity\r\non the part of big industrial users, such, for instance, as the dsuand for more paver for arming utter alumina ~\r\n--fr\r\ncontracts with largo power consuming unitlapa coupe\r\n-roe a:aerators. The difference in is ooat of power,w* vary as much\r\ntIS\t'T-4'-)'-#\r\no to t: care of tai .s oontineeacy, the TVA\r\nAnother large contingency night aria a out of a major braeakdown of largo generating or transmission facilities.\r\nI Zirr believe that to treat all of the receipts of this public utility as gteral revenue and then\treel upon direct appropriations\tt:on ss for all of its detailed expenditures would result either in reduced efficiency\r\nof tho agency moan effective\tof its use and developmont in huge bla k- *ok cone . n $ appropriations for it.\r\nboo some will argue that it can be handled through oontir ent appropriations. in a measure that is true. But let\tpoint out that this kind of blank-chuck\r\n\r\nbe an inefficient a etituts or the pronto-It mothod.\r\nAow should we ao%oAt o an item,-by-item appropriation for the TIA which would be the logical stop to follow onactsaa nt of tills amendment, thrr would then be brought into focus and into the lap of Congress the myriad small items incidental to the operation of one of the nation's largest utility businesses.\r\nThese, indeed, would be bafflln6. Suppose, for instance, that we appropriated\r\na given amount to be used in a given year for automotive, vehicles. Suppose then that after this amount bad been used, the TVA had a w ekago of some esrrentiael power trucks. ..bat would be situation? It could not replsoe these\r\ntr s,e leaving the people unnerved, until an additional appropriation bill could\r\nbe pass /ed.

Obtainini,i t ..s new plant and productive facilities would be a ood stroke for everyone oc neereed, not Only for Nashville and the surrounding area but for the entire nation. Under the present method of operation, the TVA could imasdiately undertake and contract to supply that fir, after being satisfied that the increased revenues would justify the increased expenditures. But, under\r\nthe method proposed by the a nd nt, the GU,' of Nashville and tht prospective new industry m old have to look not to a busir e i contraot but to sort- ,oi Ltiaian or statesman, as the ease wht be, to get a new appropriation o ill passed.\r\n!cr. ,p+es kex', : hope the onae will not oast this stumbling block in the pact of a maple wbo have for so long had unequal opportunities and now look up hopefully and proudly. om are ar ,tefui for this eat investment by the people of the United States. '.le think it is a hoed investment. oonf'ideentl' behove tht it not only has already brought great dividends but that, in the future, the people\tthe bniteed States will be amply benefited as p: rewarded for every dollar invested there.\r\nI hope and believe that the conferee* representing this body in conference with representatives of the Senate will be fully aware of the taperta nce of this question to the nation as a whole as well as to the * !a in the Valley of the Tennessee'. I trust they will resist trams a eno nt and that the House will oppose it.\r\nit is a question not of private versus public ownership, which has alroodY been settled in this region, but of efficient operatic; of a drat project a saes by all the people.\r\nsad"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/8476/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:8490/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/8476/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["TVA
