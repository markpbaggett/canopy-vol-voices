Of the 3 restaurants refusing service initially, two have served members of our group on a second visit and the third has indicated in the newspaper that Negroes would be served should they return.\r\n\r\nPlans are veing made for a meeting of civic, social and religious leaders as well as owners of Negro business establishments affected by the passage of the Bill. This meeting will be educational in nature\r\nfor the purpose of informing the citizenry of the content and implications of the Civil Rights Bill. Three local attorneys, each discussing different titles of the Bill, will form the panel.\r\n\r\nUI. MR. MIKE NORTH OF THE BONANZA T. V. SERIES, stars of which have been\r\ninvited to appear at Memphis' annual Mid-South Fair, inquired of the\r\nBranch President the racial practices of the Fair. He was desirous of having this information before his group made a committment for an appearance here. Reply indicated that the Mid-South Fair now operates without racial discrimination, a job accomplished by the Memphis Branch\r\na few years ago. Commendations for Ibis refusal to appear before a segregated audience in Jackson, Mississippi were also included in the letter.\r\n\r\nVII. RELIGIOUS DISTURBANCE CASE\r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court on June 1964 upheld the conviction of seven demonstrators by the Shelby County Criminal Court. The students were charged with disturbing a religious assembly after attending a youth rally sponsored by a local church at a city park in 1960. Each student was given a sixty day jail sentence and a $200 fine. After the recent denial of the U. S. Supreme Court to retry the case, local legal counsels have asked the State Supreme Court to s-tay the sentences pending our asking for a rehearing of the appeal. Twenty-five days for this petition have been granted."},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7100/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:7101/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7100/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/volvoices","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7100","label":{"en":["NAACP Report of Executive Secretary, June 3rd thru July 7th, 1964"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/subject/african-americans-3.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/place/memphis-tenn-2.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/time-period/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/provided-by/university-of-tennessee-knoxville-libraries.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"NAACP Report of Executive Secretary, June 3rd thru July 7th, 1964 - Volunteer Voices ","description":"Untitled","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/works/naacp-report-of-executive-secretary-june-3rd-thru-july-7th-1964","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7100/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"NAACP Report of Executive Secretary, June 3rd thru July 7th, 1964"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"naacp-report-of-executive-secretary-june-3rd-thru-july-7th-1964"},"buildId":"VtjikHTri9s--itA0X0Ab","assetPrefix":"/canopy-vol-voices","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
