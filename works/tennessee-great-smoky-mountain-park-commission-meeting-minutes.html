The committee concurred that this was appropriate.\r\nMr. Cook observed that \"what is good for Great Smoky Mountain National Park is good for Tennessee and North Carolina\" and commended the commission for its ongoing and cooperative contacts with this North Carolina counterpart.\r\nMs. Gibert, Management Assistant at the park, gave a report on the fiftieth anniversary activities. She distributed copies of the CCC Homecoming and reunion program which was held on August 18, 1984 and copies of the Knoxville Symphony Concert at Cades Cove which was held on September 9, 1984. Ms. Gibert reported that the fiftieth anniversary corporation will break even and was commended for a tasteful year-long celebration that could only be regarded by the commission as a success. Ms. Gibert reported that there was an increased awareness of the park nationally with over 800 newspaper clippings representing a readership of over 60 million people. She also observed the television and magazine coverage was excellent and that there were over 2,000 entries into the photo contest. A frame show is available of the winners of the photo contest and is already booked for exhibition through November. She indicated that requests for exhibition of the winning photographs could be obtained by contacting Ben Humphreys at the Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce at 436-4178.\r\nIn further reporting on the homecoming activities of the CCC Ms. Gibert observed that over 900 attended when an expected attendance numbered 500. She reported that the Cades Cove symphony went well with no visible damage to the Cove by the 7,500 attending the concert. Mr. Cook observed that those attending were highly cooperative and that after they had left the concert area he doubted that one-half bag of trash had to be picked up, the people policing their own area. Acknowledgment of the kind cooperation of the Knoxville Symphony and the excellent weather and success for the concert as indicated by an extensive number of thank-you notes was observed.\r\nThe commission indicated that they hope that reasonable cooperation as to the fiftieth anniversary would continue in the spirit of the excellent result of the fiftieth anniversary celebration.\r\nMr. Ro Wauer of the National Park Service reported the International Biosphere Conference to be held from November 26 through 29 at the Parkview Hotel in Gatlinburg was proceeding smoothly and had every appearance of being an excellent conference on the management of biospheres. He indicated the responses from Canada, Mexico, South America, and Europe were favorable. He further indicated that major topics would include the evolution of protected areas including the Glacer-Waterton area and other biosphere areas. He indicated that name speakers were attending and that the sessions were open to any member of the public with all activities available accepting room reservations for a fee of approximately $51 or $52. He indicated that Commissioner Charles A. Howell, III has been invited to attend.\r\n,Great Smoky Mountain Park Commission October 5, 1984 Minutes"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:7204/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Tennessee Great Smoky Mountain Park Commission Meeting Minutes : page 3"]},"width":3428,"height":4428,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7203~datastream~JP2/full/429,554/0/default.jpg","width":429,"height":554,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7203~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2/page/volvoices:7203","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2/page/volvoices:7203/656e2d171aef7","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7203~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3428,"height":4428,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7203~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2/annopage-2","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2/annopage-2/annotation-2","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"3\r\n\r\n\r\nA report on the hog fencing program was given and it was indicated that the area was well signed so that hikers would understand the protective nature of the fences being erected through the botanical environment being protected.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook submitted a detailed report of the first 9 months for 1984 to the commission, copy attached. Mr. Cook amplified his written report by indicating that park use was proceeding as anticipated with a good year but not a record\r\nyear and that this corresponded to predictions at the beginning of the anniversary year. He indicated that while park visits were up approximately 2 percent and that camping was up approximately 7 percent that backcountry use was down approximately 9 percent from a previous year's reduction. He indicated that this was a nationwide trend and was not unique to the Smokies. He indicated thatSlama use was restricted to the horse trails and encouraged the commission to visit the Tremont Center while it was still active. He commended the Tremont Environmental Center for a well run program.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook indicated that road resurfacing would be proceeding during the next season and that part of that contract would involve removal of the landslide refuse which has previously blocked the roads this year. He indicated that the new fishing regulations were helping and seemed to be well received generally.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook observed the air and water quality was always a potential threat to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and would continue to be very closely monitored.\r\n\r\nThe details of Mr. Cook's report should be obtained from the attached copy.\r\n\r\nMr. Stanley Canter, head of visitor services at the park presented a report to the commission in response to its request following Mr. Cook's statement in the June 8 meeting that visitor services was an area of special concern to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Canter reported that he had 8 permanent employees, 20 temporary employees, and a budget of 1984 of 409,000 dollars. He indicated that this served three visitor's centers, 7 amphi-theaters, and the various nature trails and roads in the park. Mr. Canter reported that 14 AM radio transmitter stations were in operation and that a comparative study with other national parks indicated that visitor services were low at the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and that this represented an unfortunate but omnipresent situation. Mr. Canter reported that during the summer an average of ten and one-half nature walks were held each day and 4.6 camp fire programs daily for the 7 amphi-theaters. He indicated that the spring and fall figures were even lower and that the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and Natural History Association provided much helpful and needed support for the programs held at Minges and Cable Mill.\r\n\r\nA cycle of difficulties including lack of housing available for the volunteers in parks program, for interns, and for seasonal employees resulted in fewer people being available in these areas. Mr. Cook indicated that it is \"difficult to quantify and put value on interpretive services\" as compared to enforcement\r\nGreat Smoky Mountain Park Commission October 5, 1984 Minutes"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/2"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:7203/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["Tennessee Great Smoky Mountain Park Commission Meeting Minutes : page 4"]},"width":3433,"height":4422,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7202~datastream~JP2/full/429,553/0/default.jpg","width":429,"height":553,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7202~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3/page/volvoices:7202","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3/page/volvoices:7202/656e2d183cddc","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7202~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3433,"height":4422,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7202~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3"}]}],"annotations":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3/annopage-3","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7201/canvas/3/annopage-3/annotation-3","type":"Annotation","motivation":"commenting","body":{"type":"TextualBody","language":"en","format":"text/plain","value":"4\r\n\r\n\r\nservices, road patrol, search and rescue, automobile accidents, etc. Mr. Cook and Mr. Canter indicated that this area would receive ongoing attention and the commission indicated that it would be interested in hearing further feed-back on this area that has been identified as an area of concern. The commission congratulated visitor services on the excellent renovation of the Sugarlands Visitor's Center and indicated that it was a remarkable improvement. Mr. Canter shared with the commission the-recently published Naturalist Notebook which contained the drawings on display in the visitor's center and was commended for his accomplishing on production, and sales through the cooperation of the park's Natural History Association.\r\n\r\nThe Park Superintendent, Mr. Cook reported that certain requests have been received for use of park land by concessionairs for parking and that these re-quests have been denied. The commission indicated that it was their sense that this was a totally appropriate decision.\r\n\r\nThe Gatlinburg Chamber of Commerce was noted with appreciation for holding the zoning of areas adjacent to the park to residential and minimizing commercial intrusion.\r\n\r\nMr. Cook reported that progress was being made on the Eagle Creek houseboat removal through referring the problem to the Tennessee Valley Authority as the appropriate agency. Mr. Cook indicated that the Parsons Branch Road repairs had been completed. Brief discussion of the appropriateness of trail bridges then took place. Mr. Eubanks indicated that the park would be very conservative in bridge construction and the need for bridges on hiking trails would be the subject of ongoing evaluations. He indicated that he had personally checked trails in the Eagle Creek area recently and that they would be inappropriate with regard to bridging.\r\n\r\nIt was reported by Mr. Dick Moeller that the United States Air Force plane debris on Inadu Knob has been removed from the area surrounding the Appalachian trail by the Air Force and the status of the Appalachian trail was clear on a report he had received in August. He observed that there were approximately 30 air crash sites in the park and it was impossible to clear all the sites but that the Appalachian trail corridor has been cleared of this particular crash by the United States Air Force. The commission indicated that they were pleased to hear this as several citizen complaints had been received regarding this situation.\r\n\r\nThere being no further business the meeting adjourned at 4:45 p.m. on direction of the Chairman.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted,\r\nNeil F.
