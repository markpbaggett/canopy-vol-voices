Others went to their own homes or into service. The catalogue of the future will show wider results. The boys in the print shop are getting out a paper that augurs well for a few good negro printers when the course has been completed.\r\nA recent graduate of Howe went to Me-harry Medical College, Nashville, for the course in dentistry, and attained the highest average of all competitors before the state examination board of Mississippi and is now a practicing dentist at Natchez. One boy, Monroe Allen, after graduating, went West and is recognized as one of the founders of Red Bud, Okla., having bought land there and erected a mill and gin with his own hands.\r\nSETTLEMENT WORK\r\nSettlement work of a kind is done at Howe. There is a free kindergarten for negro children of the neighborhood, and the student teachers inculcate many good and wholesome lessons along with the daily study. Other children are invited in and entertained after a fashion that means mission work when applied at home. The Bible class connected with Howe draws its members from many homes and represents all ages. Not long ago a preacher remarked to one of the older women : \"By and by you women will be getting ready to preach, you study the Bible so much.\" \"We don't want to preach,\" said this anti-suffragist, \"but we'll certainly be able to tell good preaching when we hear it. It will make the preachers study more.\"\r\nThe institute is owned and controlled by the negro Baptists of Tennessee. There are 43 churches of this faith in Memphis alone, with 10,000 members. There are 140,000 in the en-tire state. They see that money is raised forthe school when needed. Each room in the new dormitory is maintained by some church. Toward the building recently completed, the General Education Board gave $5,000; and Mr. Charles Howe, son of the founder gave $4,200.\r\nThe head of the institute is one of the progressive negroes of the South. When he came to Memphis seven years ago it was with the indorsement and recommendation of the Hon. R. B. Glenn, then governor of North Carolina, from which state Fuller hails. As Fuller was the last negro to serve in the legislature of his state, and as Gov. Glenn was a member at the same time, the value of the indorsement can be appreciated. He was called \"an industrious citizen and a safe leader of his race,\" and has more than justified the confidence of his white neighbors in his work here. His progress is slow, but sure; his aims are practical and sane; his institute pays as it goes, and when the negro students have availed themselves of the opportunities he offers the upbuilding of the race here in this center of a great negro population will have had a needed impetus.\r\nPublished by the American Baptist Home Mission Society\r\n312 Fourth Avenue, New York City.\r\n10M-12.Oi\r\nA lirartirat\r\nTHE STORY OF jf)oiue nOtitute\r\nMemphis, Tennessee\r\na s t o l d by a\r\nDaily Newspaper\r\nWhat it is accomplishing\r\nwith the aid of the\r\nNOME 7'CISSION SOCIETY\r\nPublished by\r\nTHE AMERICAN BAPTIST HOME MISSION SOCIETY\r\n312 Fourth Avenue, New York City, N. Y.\r\nA GLANCE .AT THE SCHOOL\r\nUT on St. Paul street, be- '\r\ntween Wellington and\r\nLauderdale, there is a new\r\nbuilding that promises to\r\nmean much to the indus-\r\ntrial uplift of the negroes\r\nof Memphis and of the ad-\r\njoining territory. It is the\r\nnewly completed dormitory of Howe Institute and is designed for the use of the out of town negro girls who attend the institution. An old lot, some 30 feet below the street level, was acquired by the far-seeing principal of Bowe, and after a 14-foot fill had been made he had the three-story brick dormitory built at the back of the lot and the front part is to be made into a sunken garden that will be in itself an argument for civic improvement in Memphis.\r\nBowe Institute is 21 years old, owing its inception to the interest of Northern missionaries, Peter Howe, of Illinois, being the first benefactor. It was the outgrowth of a movement to fit the negro for making his way in the world as a capable worker. It was to counteract the spirit of idleness and indolence that followed in the steps of the emancipation proclamation.\r\nThe first school was held in a church. Now a big red brick building, wood working shop, the principal's cottage, a brick church of artistic and refined architecture and the new dormitory for girls form a promising colony that should grow if the plans of Rev. T. O. Fuller, the principal, work out satisfactorily.\r\nThere are 258 pupils enrolled. All of these take the literary course. Forty per\r\ncent. take the' domestic cience courses. It is not a free institution, yet 60 per cent. of the pupils are earning their way, wholly or in part, through the various courses. Seventy per cent. of the boy students work as servants in white families in Memphis, giving their time before and after school hours and on Saturdays in exchange for their room and board and a small wage. These pupils are required by the institute to be neat, truthful and polite, and to give notice if they expect to leave their places. Otherwise they are refused further endorsement when looking for outside work.\r\nGirls are rarely placed outside the institute. The principal says he has found that housing and protection are inadequate for them in the average servant's room and they are safer in the school. Therefore, the new dormitory. These girls may earn their way in the school by working at so much per hour if they wish. All are expected to be en-rolled in the domestic science classes and the equipment is exceptionally fine for such work. In the new dormitory a kitchen, laundry, ironing room and model dining room have been planned. Practical work will be done there. All the rooms--reception room, library, lecture hall, bed rooms, bath room and dining room--are large, airy and well lighted, Professor Fuller having drawn the plans himself with these points especially in view. The domestic course will also include plain and fancy sewing, millinery, housekeeping and nursing.\r\nINDUSTRIAL WORK\r\nOne room in the building has been fitted up free by a local company and a demonstrator will be furnished to teach all the girls the use of gas and electric ranges. An especially interesting feature of this is that any negrocook in Memphis who wishes to know how t, operate her mistress' gas range is invited tl come there and learn, free of charge any am all things needful. This is to prevent waste fulness in using gas and to minimize the danger that may arise from ignorance.\r\nThe institute is expecting this year to haul the co-operation of the Housekeepers' Clul and of similar domestic science organization: in the lecture course for the students. Mem- bers of these clubs have been invited to appear before the student body and talk or the relation of mistress and maid, and to offer suggestions as to what is expected of a good, well-equipped domestic. This is an innovation that is expected to result in much mutual benefit.\r\nA good many years ago some Northern missionaries, interested in the Howe Institute because of the industrial features that were supposed to be a part of it, came to Memphis to visit the school and lend the aid of their influence, if not of their purses, to its advancement. They found some good Latin and Greek exercises on the blackboard, which one of the guests frankly owned he could not read, but the windows were dim with dirt and the trades and domestic sciences were not in evidence.\r\nIt is the intention of the present principal to elaborate on the industrial features, which he declares are, as yet, inadequate. One of his graduates is now at Tuskegee fitting him-self to teach the trades in the shops at an early date. The boys will study upholstering, carpentry, kalsomining, bricklaying, painting, printing, grading, sodding, etc., at an early date. A glance over the catalogue shows that within the past 16 years, where record has been kept of the 200 graduates, there have been 13 who became stenographers and type-writers, 16 teachers, 5 physicians, 5 ministers, 1 music teacher, 2 dentists, 2 seamstresses,"},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7357/canvas/0"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:7359/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]},{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7357/canvas/1","type":"Canvas","label":{"none":["A Practical School, The Story of Howe Institute : page 2"]},"width":3692,"height":2391,"thumbnail":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7358~datastream~JP2/full/462,299/0/default.jpg","width":462,"height":299,"type":"Image","format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7358~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]}],"items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7357/canvas/1/page/volvoices:7358","type":"AnnotationPage","items":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7357/canvas/1/page/volvoices:7358/656e2d3e0acce","type":"Annotation","motivation":"painting","body":{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7358~datastream~JP2/full/full/0/default.jpg","type":"Image","width":3692,"height":2391,"format":"image/jpeg","service":[{"@id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/iiif/2/collections~islandora~object~volvoices:7358~datastream~JP2","@type":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}]},"target":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/notdereferenceable/assemble/manifest/volvoices/7357/canvas/1"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices:7358/datastream/HOCR","type":"Dataset","label":{"none":["HOCR"]},"format":"text/vnd.hocr+html","profile":"http://kba.cloud/hocr-spec/1.2/"}]}],"seeAlso":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7357/datastream/MODS","type":"Dataset","label":{"en":["Bibliographic Description in MODS"]},"format":"application/xml","profile":"http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/mods-3-5.xsd"}],"partOf":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/assemble/collection/collections/volvoices","type":"Collection"}],"homepage":[{"id":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7357","label":{"en":["A Practical School, The Story of Howe Institute"]},"type":"Text","format":"text/html"}],"behavior":["paged"]},"related":["https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/date/undefined.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/subject/religion-2.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/place/tennessee-shelby-county.json?sort=random","https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/api/facet/time-period/undefined.json?sort=random"],"seo":{"title":"A Practical School, The Story of Howe Institute - Volunteer Voices ","description":"Untitled","canonical":"https://markpbaggett.github.io/canopy-vol-voices/works/a-practical-school-the-story-of-howe-institute","openGraph":{"images":[{"url":"https://digital.lib.utk.edu/collections/islandora/object/volvoices%3A7357/datastream/TN","type":"image/jpeg","width":200,"height":200,"alt":"A Practical School, The Story of Howe Institute"}]}},"referencingContent":[]},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/works/[slug]","query":{"slug":"a-practical-school-the-story-of-howe-institute"},"buildId":"x2N5liAXTZg5akZ-QuxGP","assetPrefix":"/canopy-vol-voices","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
